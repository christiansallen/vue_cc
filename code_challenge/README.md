# code_challenge

To get a better idea of how you build your web applications, I would like to see you build a simple application using test data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/.

I would like you to complete this challenge using Vue.js and upload to GitHub for me to clone and test through localhost.

The application should make use of the users, albums, and photos data from the jsonplaceholder api to show a list of all the users, each user should have a link to another page that displays all the
albums that user has created, and those albums selectable to show the photos in them. You should also have navigation to return to the users, and albums pages.
This should be completed as a single page application that does not refresh the browser when switching between pages. And you should be able to complete this challenge using only Front-End code.
